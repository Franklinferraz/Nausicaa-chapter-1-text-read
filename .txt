In a few short centuries, industrial civilization had spread from the western fringes of Eurasia to sprawl across the face of the planet. Plundering the soil of its riches, fouling the air, and remolding lifeforms at will, this gargantuan industrial society had already peaked a thousand years after its foundation: ahead lay abrupt and violent decline. The cities burned, welling up as clouds of poison in the war remembered as the seven days of fire. The complex and sophisticated technological superstructure was lost; almost all the surface of the earth was transformed into a sterile wasterland. Industrial civilization was never rebuilt as mankind lived on through the long twilight years...

[She talking alone] - Reflexing: These are the marks of an Ohmu's teeth... I'm sure of it.
-There's never been one in this area before...

[Page 08]
-I thought so!
-He's gorging himself...
-Perhaps he's just shed his skin.
-It's still fresh... he must have shed it just this morning. KONGG
-Sounds lovely...
-How beautiful... I've never seen a complete Ohmu shell before...

[Page 09]
-They'll be able to use it just as it is, with no extra hardening.
-And this eyeshield would make a perfect gunship canopy!
-The armorers will be dancing in the streets when they hear about this!
-Well, well! It can chip even a ceramic blade!
-HYAH! SHINGG
-OWWW OW!
-Tok tok
-If I carry just one, I should still be able to get off the ground..
-BOMF
-Kchik
-Oh! It's so light... so beautiful...
-Kang Kang

[Page 10]
-The breadfungus are scattering their spores... trying to heal the wound that Ohmu made...
-To him, this gloomy forest must seem a warm and comforting place.
-Just like snow...
[Thinking]-I wonder what sort of world Ohmu sees through his fourteen eyes...
-But humans can't walk here unmasked for even five minutes, or our lungs would decay. A forest of death...
-Who?!
-He killed us!
-They've stopped...

[Page 11]
-Wait... it's not a human cry... it's inside my head!

-Killed us!
-Killed us!
-He killed us!

-We will kill him!
-Killed us!
-We will kill!
-He killed us!

[Thinking]-Such terrible sadness... and violent anger...

-Kill...

[She talking...]-Where are you? Can you tell me...
[She crying...]-Why are you spreading such hatred?
-Who are you?! Who's out there?!
-AA!

-Kill!!
-Heeeeoooouuuuuuuuu

[She thinking]-It's gone...

[She talking alone]-The forest insects must be attacking someone!

-Heeeeoooouuuuuuuuu

[She talking alone]-Another!

[She talking alone]-That sound... a siren shell!
-I can't see any thing from down here...

-Heeeeoooouuuuuuuuu

[She talking alone]-That sound... a siren shell!

[Page 12]

-SKRASH

[She talking alone]-There!
[She thinking]-Royals Yanmas! And so many of them... !

-AAA!

[She talking alone]-An Ohmu's attacking someone! OHMU!
-But the spores shouldn't be stirred up like that... like smoke...

[Page 13]
[She talking alone]-Since he uses siren shells, he's sure to recognize this...
-SNIK
-He'll never scape the forest going that direction...
-Maybe it's an arms merchant...

-SSHUU
-BLAM

[She talking someone]-Hear me!!

-SKEEEEEE

[She talking alone]-He heard! He's comming!
-2,1...

-CHUK
-BLAM

-SHOOM

[She talking alone]-3

-FESSH
-VWSSHFI

[She talking alone]-Isn't that...?
-Go up-wind!!

[Page 15]

[She talking alone]-!

[Ohmu's buzzing]-SKASSH

[Page 16]
[She talking alone]-What a magnificent Ohmu!!

-SHOOM
-SWSShhh

[She thinking]-Even though he left the forest, he still won't stop chasing them! He must be blind with rage...
-I'll bet he's the owner of that shell...
-He moulted only a few hours ago and already he's grown so huge!

[Page 17]
[She talking alone]-I have to calm his attack reflexes...
[She talking to the Ohmu]-Ohmu! Go back to the forest! This is not your world out here...
-We can't have you scattering all those spores you carried with you...!
[She talking alone]-That cry I heard... Could it have been this Ohmu...? 
-His eyes are burning ruby-red with anger...
-I'll have to play a little rough, I'm afraid...
-Tee-hee... surely not!

-FASH!

[Page 18]
-POOM -POOM -POOM


[Old man speaks!]-Strobe grenades!
-He's gone stone still....

[Ohmu's buzzing]-CHIK

-OUUOO  -OOUUOOUUO

[Old man speaks!]-She means to calm them without hurting them...
-A worm flute...

[Page 19]
[Big insects buzzing]-Chik -Chik -Chik

-Chik

-OOUUOOUUOOUUOOUUOOUUOOUUOOUUOOUUOOUU

-Chick

[She's talking with the monsters]-Your enemy is gone... everyone, let's return to the forest!
[Old man speaks alone]-Incredible... it's almost as if she can read their minds...

[She's talking with the monsters]-Let's return to the forest... leave this cold world...

[Old man speaks with the girl]-My thanks! I'll go on ahead and wait!

-OUUOO

[She's talking with the monsters]-Farewell, Ohmu...
-Forgive me for using those strobe grenades! We'll make good use of your shell...

-SKRSH

[Page 20]
-OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

-OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

[She speaks with the old guy]-Master Yupa!

[Old man speaks with her]-Oho! I thought so!
-Ha ha ha! Nausicaä, how you've grown!
-I've been saved by the little girl I used to carry!

[Page 21]
[Nausicaä speaks with Master Yupa]-Oh, Yupa... its been more than a year!
[Master Yupa]-What a finerider you've become Nausicaä...
[Nausicaä]-Not at all! Father says I'm still... Mm?

-SKEE

[Master Yupa]-Oh, yes... I'd forgotten all about you, little one. You've caused me a great deal of trouble, haven't you?

[Nausicaä]-Yupa! It's a squirrelfox!

[Master Yupa]-I have no idea where it caught him, but I saw a royal Yanma carring this rascal off. I mistook him for a human baby and made the error of using my gun.

[Nausicaä]-So that's what enraged the Ohmu into attacking you... !

-OOOOOOOOOOOOOO

[Nausicaä]-The little devil had passed out, so he didn't inhale any of the forest poisons.

[Nausicaä thinking]-Here, here...
-Come on...
