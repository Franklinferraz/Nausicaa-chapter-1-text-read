[Page 05]
In a few short centuries, industrial civilization had spread from the western fringes of Eurasia to sprawl across the face of the planet. Plundering the soil of its riches, fouling the air, and remolding lifeforms at will, this gargantuan industrial society had already peaked a thousand years after its foundation: ahead lay abrupt and violent decline. The cities burned, welling up as clouds of poison in the war remembered as the seven days of fire. The complex and sophisticated technological superstructure was lost; almost all the surface of the earth was transformed into a sterile wasterland. Industrial civilization was never rebuilt as mankind lived on through the long twilight years...

[She talking alone] - Reflexing: These are the marks of an Ohmu's teeth... I'm sure of it.
-There's never been one in this area before...

[Page 08]
-I thought so!
-He's gorging himself...
-Perhaps he's just shed his skin.
-It's still fresh... he must have shed it just this morning. KONGG
-Sounds lovely...
-How beautiful... I've never seen a complete Ohmu shell before...

[Page 09]
-They'll be able to use it just as it is, with no extra hardening.
-And this eyeshield would make a perfect gunship canopy!
-The armorers will be dancing in the streets when they hear about this!
-Well, well! It can chip even a ceramic blade!
-HYAH! SHINGG
-OWWW OW!
-Tok tok
-If I carry just one, I should still be able to get off the ground..
-BOMF
-Kchik
-Oh! It's so light... so beautiful...
-Kang Kang

[Page 10]
-The breadfungus are scattering their spores... trying to heal the wound that Ohmu made...
-To him, this gloomy forest must seem a warm and comforting place.
-Just like snow...
[Thinking]-I wonder what sort of world Ohmu sees through his fourteen eyes...
-But humans can't walk here unmasked for even five minutes, or our lungs would decay. A forest of death...
-Who?!
-He killed us!
-They've stopped...

[Page 11]
-Wait... it's not a human cry... it's inside my head!

-Killed us!
-Killed us!
-He killed us!

-We will kill him!
-Killed us!
-We will kill!
-He killed us!

[Thinking]-Such terrible sadness... and violent anger...

-Kill...

[She talking...]-Where are you? Can you tell me...
[She crying...]-Why are you spreading such hatred?
-Who are you?! Who's out there?!
-AA!

-Kill!!
-Heeeeoooouuuuuuuuu

[She thinking]-It's gone...

[She talking alone]-The forest insects must be attacking someone!

-Heeeeoooouuuuuuuuu

[She talking alone]-Another!

[She talking alone]-That sound... a siren shell!
-I can't see any thing from down here...

-Heeeeoooouuuuuuuuu

[She talking alone]-That sound... a siren shell!

[Page 12]

-SKRASH

[She talking alone]-There!
[She thinking]-Royals Yanmas! And so many of them... !

-AAA!

[She talking alone]-An Ohmu's attacking someone! OHMU!
-But the spores shouldn't be stirred up like that... like smoke...

[Page 13]
[She talking alone]-Since he uses siren shells, he's sure to recognize this...
-SNIK
-He'll never scape the forest going that direction...
-Maybe it's an arms merchant...

-SSHUU
-BLAM

[She talking someone]-Hear me!!

-SKEEEEEE

[She talking alone]-He heard! He's comming!
-2,1...

-CHUK
-BLAM

[Page 14]
-SHOOM

[She talking alone]-3

-FESSH
-VWSSHFI

[She talking alone]-Isn't that...?
-Go up-wind!!

[Page 15]

[She talking alone]-!

[Ohmu's buzzing]-SKASSH

[Page 16]
[She talking alone]-What a magnificent Ohmu!!

-SHOOM
-SWSShhh

[She thinking]-Even though he left the forest, he still won't stop chasing them! He must be blind with rage...
-I'll bet he's the owner of that shell...
-He moulted only a few hours ago and already he's grown so huge!

[Page 17]
[She talking alone]-I have to calm his attack reflexes...
[She talking to the Ohmu]-Ohmu! Go back to the forest! This is not your world out here...
-We can't have you scattering all those spores you carried with you...!
[She talking alone]-That cry I heard... Could it have been this Ohmu...? 
-His eyes are burning ruby-red with anger...
-I'll have to play a little rough, I'm afraid...
-Tee-hee... surely not!

-FASH!

[Page 18]
-POOM -POOM -POOM


[Old man speaks!]-Strobe grenades!
-He's gone stone still....

[Ohmu's buzzing]-CHIK

-OUUOO  -OOUUOOUUO

[Old man speaks!]-She means to calm them without hurting them...
-A worm flute...

[Page 19]
[Big insects buzzing]-Chik -Chik -Chik

-Chik

-OOUUOOUUOOUUOOUUOOUUOOUUOOUUOOUUOOUU

-Chick

[She's talking with the monsters]-Your enemy is gone... everyone, let's return to the forest!
[Old man speaks alone]-Incredible... it's almost as if she can read their minds...

[She's talking with the monsters]-Let's return to the forest... leave this cold world...

[Old man speaks with the girl]-My thanks! I'll go on ahead and wait!

-OUUOO

[She's talking with the monsters]-Farewell, Ohmu...
-Forgive me for using those strobe grenades! We'll make good use of your shell...

-SKRSH

[Page 20]
-OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

-OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

[She speaks with the old guy]-Master Yupa!

[Old man speaks with her]-Oho! I thought so!
-Ha ha ha! Nausicaä, how you've grown!
-I've been saved by the little girl I used to carry!

[Page 21]
[Nausicaä speaks with Master Yupa]-Oh, Yupa... its been more than a year!
[Master Yupa]-What a finerider you've become Nausicaä...
[Nausicaä]-Not at all! Father says I'm still... Mm?

-SKEE

[Master Yupa]-Oh, yes... I'd forgotten all about you, little one. You've caused me a great deal of trouble, haven't you?

[Nausicaä]-Yupa! It's a squirrelfox!

[Master Yupa]-I have no idea where it caught him, but I saw a royal Yanma carring this rascal off. I mistook him for a human baby and made the error of using my gun.

[Nausicaä]-So that's what enraged the Ohmu into attacking you... !

-OOOOOOOOOOOOOO

[Nausicaä]-The little devil had passed out, so he didn't inhale any of the forest poisons.

[Nausicaä thinking]-Here, here...
-Come on...

[Squirrelfox is Growling]

-HSSS

[Master Yupa speaks with Nausicaä]-Now, now!
-You shouldn't put outa your hand like that... he's still wild!

-HSSSS

[Nausicaä thinking]-It's all right... don't be afraid...

-KEE

-!

[Page 22]
[Nausicaä thinking]-See... don't be afraid.
-You were frightened weren't you? But it's all right now.
-See?

[Nausicaä speaks with Yupa]-Master Yupa, can I keep him? Please?

[Master Yupa]-Of... of course...

-COOO

-COOO

[Nausicaä speaks with the big Chicken]-Kui! kai! You remembered me!

-COO
-COO

[Yupa thinking]-Such a mysterious power she has... even over a squirrelfox, and they never take to people...

[Nausicaä speaks with the chicken]-You two won't need your chaps for the rest of the journey.. let me take them off for you.

[Nausicaä speaks with Yupa]-I'm so glad you got today! We could leave for the front as early as tomorrow...

[Yupa]-So, it's war.

[Nausicaä]-We received a mobilization order from the Vai emperor.
-Jhil is getting old. This will be a hard campaign for him...
-Father isn't going. I am.

[Yupa]-Nausicaä... to war?!
-That's absurd! Who agreed to such foolishness?

-OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

[Nausicaä]-It's was the only way. Father and I decided.

[page 23]
[Nausicaä speaks with Yupa]-Father said it was time to hand down the weapons to me.

[Master Yupa]-I see...
-The forest poisons have invaded his body...

[Nausicaä]-Yes. We live beside the sea of corruption, so it is our destiny...

[Narrator]-The sea of corruptiom was the new world... an ecological system born in the polluted wastelands created by civilizations long past. Only the great insects could live amongst the giant fungi and the  miasma they exhaled, and so the earth was slowly submerging seneath that decaying sea...

[Yupa]-Alas... I should have come sooner...

[Nausicaä]-Don't say that.
-But it's so good that you came. There is something I wanted you to see before we left for the front.
-If you start down into the valley now, you'll reach the castle while it's still light.
-I'll go on ahead and tell father.

[Yupa]-Nausicaä... how you have grown.

[Narrator]-A thousand years had passed since the Mammoth industrial civilizations of the past had dimished, and faded into the dark vastness of the time. It was the closing of the ceramic era.
-The valley of wind was a small kingdom on the edge of the frontier, given frail protection against the poisons of the sea of corruption by the constant winds blowing through from the ocean.

[Page 24]
[Yupa speaks with the Women of the village]-For the wise women, I bring the Khotosh berbs you asked of me.

-Aahh!

[Woman of the village]-Aahh!
-The finest gift of all!
-With these, many an infant who might have died will live...

[Yupa]-Nausicaä, call forth all the young maidens who had their hair put up while I was away.

[Nausicaä]-Very well. Nekari... Tocto...
-Come forward!

[Yupa]-These are stones from the river Tiara that runs through the sea of corruption. Let them adorn your  garments on the day of your wedding.

[Woman of the village]-Oh, master Yupa! Thank you so much!
-They're... they're so beautiful!

[Man of the village]-Hahaha... now,then for whom will you wear them?

-HA HA HA

[Page 25]
[Yupa]-Our old friend returns to us on this fortuitious day when the planting is ended.

[Nausicaä's father]-Everyone will be wanting to hear your tales of distant lands.

[Man of the village]-Let us throw open the pantries of the castle! Tonight, we feast and celebrate to our heart's content!

-HAHAHAHA -Ha Ha

[Yupa thinking]-Ah, but it puts my heart at ease to visit this valley.
-Yet even here...

[Man of the village]-There are fewer people each time I return.

[Nausicaä's father]Yupa my friend... I know what you are thinking but for tonight, let us cast aside such unpleasant musings.

[Nausicaä]-Master Yupa, please try some of this year's wine.

[Yupa]-Ah, Nausicaä... you said you had something you wished to show me...?

[Nausicaä]-It can wait until tomorrow...
-Everyone would be angry if I kept you to myself tonight.
-Even father is itching to hear your stories!

-HAHAHA

[Man of the village]-Princess! Princess!
-Did you really see an Ohmu?

[Yupa speaks with her father]-She has become a beautiful princess indeed...

[Nausicaä's father]-Mm, and yet, if only she'd been a boy... I would have no complaints.

[Yupa]-We had eleven children, the queen and I, but only one could we raise to adulthood.

-HOHO -HAHAHA

[Page 26]
-FSSS

[man of the village]-Aye, it's a wonderful thing you've found! Seems some good can come of your poking in about in the rotwood, princess.

[Nausicaä]-What's that? And just who was it that kept muttering about "not going near the forest"...?

-HA HA HA
[Man of the village]-Still, finding an Ohmu shell be the luck of a lifetime I'll warrant.

[Nausicaä]-I want to take her up for a bit.
-Uncle Mito! Will you be copilot?

[Other man of the village]-Princess, you that squirrelfox Rascal will be all right?

[Nausicaä]-He can handle anything now... can't you, Teto?

[Men of the village]-Copilot go!
-Pilot go! Fire engines!

[Page 27]
[Yupa]-The gunship! Would that be Nausicaä?

[Father's Nausicaä]-Mm. I shouldn't brag about my own daughter, but she's fine pilot.

[Yupa]-She has the heart for it. With just the touch of a breeze on her skin, she can read the soul of the wind... far better than her father ever could.

[Nausicaä's Father]-The heart of all in this valley belong to her. There's no record of a woman becoming chieftain before, but I don't doubt she can do it.

[Yupa]-So then you really do propose to send her off to battle...

[Nausicaä's Father]-We're a tiny country, Yupa... less than 500 people. That we've managed to keep our autonomy at all is entirely due to the gunship.
-The chieftain of the valley of wind must serve under the Torumekian emperor as a gunship pilot.. so say the ancient treaties. We must obey them.

[Yupa]-Well do I know this is a foolish war. Yet in this harsh world of ours, the sparrow must live like a hawk if he is to fly at all.

[Page 28]
-VOOSHH -WHSS
[Uncle Mito]-Scarlet tri-jewel! Velocity 205 leagues!
-235!
-240!
-245!
-275!
-Princess! We're too low!
-300!
-White heart-jewel! Engine at maximum!

-WHOOOOOOOM

[Page 29]
[Uncle Mito]-Now, then! If you want to stay alive best rein in that foolishness!
-You fly this gunship as if she were a one-man glider the likes of your Mehve.
-Firstly, by flying so low... even by luck you evade the enemy's guns, you'll pin yourself on his spears!

[Nausicaä]-Forgive me, uncle Mito! But look...! You're so steamed up...

-SSSHHH

[Uncle Mito]-You're leaving a cloud behind!

[Nausicaä thinking]-I prefer my Mehve.
-Still what an ugly ship it is...
-The gunship cuts through the wind but Mehve rides upon it...

-They Killed us! They killed us!

[Nausicaä thinking]-That cry! Again!

-We will kill! We will kill them!

[Page 30]
[Nausicaä thinking]-Come...

-Kill...
-Kill them...

[Nausicaä thinking]-It's close...
-There, now... come to me...
-Who are you? Why do you radiate such hatred?
-... ...

[Nausicaä speaks alone]-Such pain... such bitter sadness...

-KEEE!

-!

[Uncle Teto]-Princess! Are you all right?!
-Princess pull up!

-SHEE

[Nausicaä]-Thank you, Teto...

-PVOM

[Page 31]
-SHEEAA
[Uncle Teto]-Princess what on earth...

[Nausicaä]-Put on your mask, uncle!
-We-re going to sea of corruption!
