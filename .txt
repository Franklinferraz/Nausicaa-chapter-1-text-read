[Page 05]
In a few short centuries, industrial civilization had spread from the western fringes of Eurasia to sprawl across the face of the planet. Plundering the soil of its riches, fouling the air, and remolding lifeforms at will, this gargantuan industrial society had already peaked a thousand years after its foundation: ahead lay abrupt and violent decline. The cities burned, welling up as clouds of poison in the war remembered as the seven days of fire. The complex and sophisticated technological superstructure was lost; almost all the surface of the earth was transformed into a sterile wasterland. Industrial civilization was never rebuilt as mankind lived on through the long twilight years...

[She talking alone] - Reflexing: These are the marks of an Ohmu's teeth... I'm sure of it.
-There's never been one in this area before...

[Page 08]
-I thought so!
-He's gorging himself...
-Perhaps he's just shed his skin.
-It's still fresh... he must have shed it just this morning. KONGG
-Sounds lovely...
-How beautiful... I've never seen a complete Ohmu shell before...

[Page 09]
-They'll be able to use it just as it is, with no extra hardening.
-And this eyeshield would make a perfect gunship canopy!
-The armorers will be dancing in the streets when they hear about this!
-Well, well! It can chip even a ceramic blade!
-HYAH! SHINGG
-OWWW OW!
-Tok tok
-If I carry just one, I should still be able to get off the ground..
-BOMF
-Kchik
-Oh! It's so light... so beautiful...
-Kang Kang

[Page 10]
-The breadfungus are scattering their spores... trying to heal the wound that Ohmu made...
-To him, this gloomy forest must seem a warm and comforting place.
-Just like snow...
[Thinking]-I wonder what sort of world Ohmu sees through his fourteen eyes...
-But humans can't walk here unmasked for even five minutes, or our lungs would decay. A forest of death...
-Who?!
-He killed us!
-They've stopped...

[Page 11]
-Wait... it's not a human cry... it's inside my head!

-Killed us!
-Killed us!
-He killed us!

-We will kill him!
-Killed us!
-We will kill!
-He killed us!

[Thinking]-Such terrible sadness... and violent anger...

-Kill...

[She talking...]-Where are you? Can you tell me...
[She crying...]-Why are you spreading such hatred?
-Who are you?! Who's out there?!
-AA!

-Kill!!
-Heeeeoooouuuuuuuuu

[She thinking]-It's gone...

[She talking alone]-The forest insects must be attacking someone!

-Heeeeoooouuuuuuuuu

[She talking alone]-Another!

[She talking alone]-That sound... a siren shell!
-I can't see any thing from down here...

-Heeeeoooouuuuuuuuu

[She talking alone]-That sound... a siren shell!

[Page 12]

-SKRASH

[She talking alone]-There!
[She thinking]-Royals Yanmas! And so many of them... !

-AAA!

[She talking alone]-An Ohmu's attacking someone! OHMU!
-But the spores shouldn't be stirred up like that... like smoke...

[Page 13]
[She talking alone]-Since he uses siren shells, he's sure to recognize this...
-SNIK
-He'll never scape the forest going that direction...
-Maybe it's an arms merchant...

-SSHUU
-BLAM

[She talking someone]-Hear me!!

-SKEEEEEE

[She talking alone]-He heard! He's comming!
-2,1...

-CHUK
-BLAM

-FESSH
-VWSSHFI

[She talking alone]-Isn't that...?
-Go up-wind!!

[Page 15]

[She talking alone]-!

[Ohmu's buzzing]-SKASSH

[Page 16]
[She talking alone]-What a magnificent Ohmu!!

-SHOOM
-SWSShhh

[She thinking]-Even though he left the forest, he still won't stop chasing them! He must be blind with rage...
-I'll bet he's the owner of that shell...
-He moulted only a few hours ago and already he's grown so huge!

[Page 17]
[She talking alone]-I have to calm his attack reflexes...
[She talking to the Ohmu]-Ohmu! Go back to the forest! This is not your world out here...
-We can't have you scattering all those spores you carried with you...!
[She talking alone]-That cry I heard... Could it have been this Ohmu...? 
-His eyes are burning ruby-red with anger...
-I'll have to play a little rough, I'm afraid...
-Tee-hee... surely not!

-FASH!

[Page 18]
-POOM -POOM -POOM


[Old man speaks!]-Strobe grenades!
-He's gone stone still....

[Ohmu's buzzing]-CHIK

-OUUOO  -OOUUOOUUO

[Old man speaks!]-She means to calm them without hurting them...
-A worm flute...

[Page 19]
[Big insects buzzing]-Chik -Chik -Chik

-OOUUOOUUOOUUOOUUOOUUOOUUOOUUOOUUOOUU

-Chick

[She's talking with the monsters]-Your enemy is gone... everyone, let's return to the forest!
[Old man speaks alone]-Incredible... it's almost as if she can read their minds...

[She's talking with the monsters]-Let's return to the forest... leave this cold world...

[Old man speaks with the girl]-My thanks! I'll go on ahead and wait!

-OUUOO

[She's talking with the monsters]-Farewell, Ohmu...
-Forgive me for using those strobe grenades! We'll make good use of your shell...

-SKRSH

[Page 20]
-OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

-OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

[She speaks with the old guy]-Master Yupa!

[Old man speaks with her]-Oho! I thought so!
-Ha ha ha! Nausicaä, how you've grown!
-I've been saved by the little girl I used to carry!

[Page 21]
[Nausicaä speaks with Master Yupa]-Oh, Yupa... its been more than a year!
[Master Yupa]-What a finerider you've become Nausicaä...
[Nausicaä]-Not at all! Father says I'm still... Mm?

-SKEE

[Master Yupa]-Oh, yes... I'd forgotten all about you, little one. You've caused me a great deal of trouble, haven't you?

[Nausicaä]-Yupa! It's a squirrelfox!

[Master Yupa]-I have no idea where it caught him, but I saw a royal Yanma carring this rascal off. I mistook him for a human baby and made the error of using my gun.

[Nausicaä]-So that's what enraged the Ohmu into attacking you... !

-OOOOOOOOOOOOOO

[Nausicaä]-The little devil had passed out, so he didn't inhale any of the forest poisons.

[Nausicaä thinking]-Here, here...
-Come on...

[Squirrelfox is Growling]

-HSSS

[Master Yupa speaks with Nausicaä]-Now, now!
-You shouldn't put outa your hand like that... he's still wild!

-HSSSS

[Nausicaä thinking]-It's all right... don't be afraid...

-KEE

-!

[Page 22]
[Nausicaä thinking]-See... don't be afraid.
-You were frightened weren't you? But it's all right now.
-See?

[Nausicaä speaks with Yupa]-Master Yupa, can I keep him? Please?

[Master Yupa]-Of... of course...

-COOO

-COOO

[Nausicaä speaks with the big Chicken]-Kui! kai! You remembered me!

-COO
-COO

[Yupa thinking]-Such a mysterious power she has... even over a squirrelfox, and they never take to people...

[Nausicaä speaks with the chicken]-You two won't need your chaps for the rest of the journey.. let me take them off for you.

[Nausicaä speaks with Yupa]-I'm so glad you got today! We could leave for the front as early as tomorrow...

[Yupa]-So, it's war.

[Nausicaä]-We received a mobilization order from the Vai emperor.
-Jhil is getting old. This will be a hard campaign for him...
-Father isn't going. I am.

[Yupa]-Nausicaä... to war?!
-That's absurd! Who agreed to such foolishness?

-OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

[Nausicaä]-It's was the only way. Father and I decided.

[page 23]
[Nausicaä speaks with Yupa]-Father said it was time to hand down the weapons to me.

[Master Yupa]-I see...
-The forest poisons have invaded his body...

[Nausicaä]-Yes. We live beside the sea of corruption, so it is our destiny...

[Narrator]-The sea of corruptiom was the new world... an ecological system born in the polluted wastelands created by civilizations long past. Only the great insects could live amongst the giant fungi and the  miasma they exhaled, and so the earth was slowly submerging seneath that decaying sea...

[Yupa]-Alas... I should have come sooner...

[Nausicaä]-Don't say that.
-But it's so good that you came. There is something I wanted you to see before we left for the front.
-If you start down into the valley now, you'll reach the castle while it's still light.
-I'll go on ahead and tell father.

[Yupa]-Nausicaä... how you have grown.

[Narrator]-A thousand years had passed since the Mammoth industrial civilizations of the past had dimished, and faded into the dark vastness of the time. It was the closing of the ceramic era.
-The valley of wind was a small kingdom on the edge of the frontier, given frail protection against the poisons of the sea of corruption by the constant winds blowing through from the ocean.

[Page 24]
[Yupa speaks with the Women of the village]-For the wise women, I bring the Khotosh berbs you asked of me.

-Aahh!

[Woman of the village]-Aahh!
-The finest gift of all!
-With these, many an infant who might have died will live...

[Yupa]-Nausicaä, call forth all the young maidens who had their hair put up while I was away.

[Nausicaä]-Very well. Nekari... Tocto...
-Come forward!

[Yupa]-These are stones from the river Tiara that runs through the sea of corruption. Let them adorn your  garments on the day of your wedding.

[Woman of the village]-Oh, master Yupa! Thank you so much!
-They're... they're so beautiful!

[Man of the village]-Hahaha... now,then for whom will you wear them?

-HA HA HA

[Page 25]
[Yupa]-Our old friend returns to us on this fortuitious day when the planting is ended.

[Nausicaä's father]-Everyone will be wanting to hear your tales of distant lands.

[Man of the village]-Let us throw open the pantries of the castle! Tonight, we feast and celebrate to our heart's content!

-HAHAHAHA -Ha Ha

[Yupa thinking]-Ah, but it puts my heart at ease to visit this valley.
-Yet even here...

[Man of the village]-There are fewer people each time I return.

[Nausicaä's father]Yupa my friend... I know what you are thinking but for tonight, let us cast aside such unpleasant musings.

[Nausicaä]-Master Yupa, please try some of this year's wine.

[Yupa]-Ah, Nausicaä... you said you had something you wished to show me...?

[Nausicaä]-It can wait until tomorrow...
-Everyone would be angry if I kept you to myself tonight.
-Even father is itching to hear your stories!

-HAHAHA

[Man of the village]-Princess! Princess!
-Did you really see an Ohmu?

[Yupa speaks with her father]-She has become a beautiful princess indeed...

[Nausicaä's father]-Mm, and yet, if only she'd been a boy... I would have no complaints.

[Yupa]-We had eleven children, the queen and I, but only one could we raise to adulthood.

-HOHO -HAHAHA

[Page 26]
-FSSS

[man of the village]-Aye, it's a wonderful thing you've found! Seems some good can come of your poking in about in the rotwood, princess.

[Nausicaä]-What's that? And just who was it that kept muttering about "not going near the forest"...?

-HA HA HA
[Man of the village]-Still, finding an Ohmu shell be the luck of a lifetime I'll warrant.

[Nausicaä]-I want to take her up for a bit.
-Uncle Mito! Will you be copilot?

[Other man of the village]-Princess, you that squirrelfox Rascal will be all right?

[Nausicaä]-He can handle anything now... can't you, Teto?

[Men of the village]-Copilot go!
-Pilot go! Fire engines!

[Page 27]
[Yupa]-The gunship! Would that be Nausicaä?

[Father's Nausicaä]-Mm. I shouldn't brag about my own daughter, but she's fine pilot.

[Yupa]-She has the heart for it. With just the touch of a breeze on her skin, she can read the soul of the wind... far better than her father ever could.

[Nausicaä's Father]-The heart of all in this valley belong to her. There's no record of a woman becoming chieftain before, but I don't doubt she can do it.

[Yupa]-So then you really do propose to send her off to battle...

[Nausicaä's Father]-We're a tiny country, Yupa... less than 500 people. That we've managed to keep our autonomy at all is entirely due to the gunship.
-The chieftain of the valley of wind must serve under the Torumekian emperor as a gunship pilot.. so say the ancient treaties. We must obey them.

[Yupa]-Well do I know this is a foolish war. Yet in this harsh world of ours, the sparrow must live like a hawk if he is to fly at all.

[Page 28]
-VOOSHH -WHSS
[Uncle Mito]-Scarlet tri-jewel! Velocity 205 leagues!
-235!
-240!
-245!
-275!
-Princess! We're too low!
-300!
-White heart-jewel! Engine at maximum!

-WHOOOOOOOM

[Page 29]
[Uncle Mito]-Now, then! If you want to stay alive best rein in that foolishness!
-You fly this gunship as if she were a one-man glider the likes of your Mehve.
-Firstly, by flying so low... even by luck you evade the enemy's guns, you'll pin yourself on his spears!

[Nausicaä]-Forgive me, uncle Mito! But look...! You're so steamed up...

-SSSHHH

[Uncle Mito]-You're leaving a cloud behind!

[Nausicaä thinking]-I prefer my Mehve.
-Still what an ugly ship it is...
-The gunship cuts through the wind but Mehve rides upon it...

-They Killed us! They killed us!

[Nausicaä thinking]-That cry! Again!

-We will kill! We will kill them!

[Page 30]
[Nausicaä thinking]-Come...

-Kill...
-Kill them...

[Nausicaä thinking]-It's close...
-There, now... come to me...
-Who are you? Why do you radiate such hatred?
-... ...

[Nausicaä speaks alone]-Such pain... such bitter sadness...

-KEEE!

-!

[Uncle Teto]-Princess! Are you all right?!
-Princess pull up!

-SHEE

[Nausicaä]-Thank you, Teto...

-PVOM

[Page 31]
-SHEEAA
[Uncle Teto]-Princess what on earth...

[Nausicaä]-Put on your mask, uncle!
-We-re going to sea of corruption!

[Uncle Teto]-The rot-wood?!

[Nausicaä]-Combat speed!

[Uncle Teto]-Aye, Aye! Combat speed!
[Uncle thinking]-Has the Princess lost her wits...?

[Nausicaä-thinking]-If that voice was the mindcry of an Ohmu...
-Then it's happening again... somewhere in the forest, someone is being attacked by the great insects.

-SHEEEE

[Page 32]
[Nausicaä-thinking]-Why do I feel such dread in my heart...?
-It's very close now...

[Page 33]
[Nausicaä]-The forest insects are attacking a freighter!
-It's a Brig from one of the neighboring kingdoms!

-MNCH -KRAK -SKATCH
-SKRC -KNCH -SKRAKK -BOOM

[Nausicaä]-Mito, those are landgrubs... that ship must have put down in the sea of corruption!
-The fools must have slain some of the great worms in the rotwood... they've not a chance now, princess.
-Their engines are still working...

-BOOM -KRAK -SKRNCH -BOOM

[Uncle Teto]-We have to guide them free of the forest! Mito, run up the signal flags!

-ZZZKKK

[Page34]
[Nausicaä]-(Follow we will guide you.)
-(Turn to starboard.)

-SKNCH -SKRAK -KNCK -!!

[Uncle Teto]-What is this?! There's none aboard but women and children!

[Nausicaä]-They're not turning! Their rudders are jammed!
-Mito! The muzzle flash from the main cannon might drive the grubs off the rudders... we'll try it!

[Uncle Teto]-Princess, no! If we get within reach of those devils, they'll come for us!

-VWHOOOSH

[Uncle Teto]-AA! We've lost the signal kite!

[Page 35]
[Nausicaä]-We'll duck under that block of living-worms and get as close as we can.
Keep your head down, Mito!

[Mito]-But princess... al do as you will!
-Break away at full throttle the very instant you fire, princess!

[Nausicaä]-Here we go!

-chikchik -Ckkk -Ckkk -Chkkchikchkkchik

-Chik -Chik -Chik -Chik

[Mito]-We can,t risk getting closer! Pull out or we'll stall for certain!
-We're almost there! I'm going ahead!

-Chkkk -Chkk -Chkk

[Nausicaä]-Get out of our way!!

[Page 36]
[Nausicaä]-Their rudders! We made it!

-VNNNNNN -MNCH -SKKSH -KNKN -SKNCH

[Nausicaä]-All guns--Fire!

-KOOM -KOOM

[Nausicaä]-They let go!

[Teto]-Engine full throttle!

-SHOOM -SHEEAAA

[Uncle Mito]-Princess! The last of them has come away... we're all right now!
-The rudders on that brig are freed up now. They're coming about.
-We're out of the forest... another ten leagues and we'll be clear of the miasma, too.
-More of the landgrubs are dropping free... they'll make it, I reckon.

[Nausicaä]-Uncle Mito! Their wing!!

-SKRAK -KUSHH

[Page 38]
-SHAOOOM

[Nausicaä]-NO!
-Those damned grubs chewed into their wing...!
-I'm putting down!

-KROOM

[Nausicaä]-Give me the emergecy mask!

-SKSSS

[Page 39]
[Uncle Mito]-This...this is horrible...
[Mito thinking]-None but woman and children... it's like a refugee ship.
-What on earth has happened to Pejite City...?

[Nausicaä]-Mito!

-SKRAK

[Nausicaä]-This girl still breathing.
-The mask... quickly!

[estrange girl]-W... water...

[Nausicaä]-Don't try to talk. Just breathe...

[estrange girl]-Hahh... hahh...
-You... you're from the valley of wind, aren't you? 
Thank you for... for trying to help... us...

[Nausicaä]-Hang on!

[Uncle Mito]-My lady, I see you are a princess of the house of Pejitei. 
-Do you have any parting words?

[estrange girl]-This... give this to... to my elder brother. My name is Rastel... 
Daughter of the chieftain of Pejitei...

[Page 40]
[Princess of Pejitei]-Pejitei was attacked lask night by the imperial guard of the Vai emperor of Torumekia, we were the sole survivors the enemy pursued us... we were forced to hide in the sea of corruption, the great insects came...

[Uncle Mito]-Pejitei is an Ally of Torumekia, bound by ancient treaties! Why would they...?

-Huhm -Huhm
[Princess of Pejitei]-People of the valley of wind... please give that stone to my brother.
-The vai emperor must never, NEVER have it...

[Nausicaä]-I give you my word. We'll see that none but your brother receive it. 
-Where might he be found?
-Promise... please promise...

[Princess of Pejitei]-.... -.....

[Nausicaä]-Princess... let us return to the valley. The plants of the forest scent food...
-They've released their spores. In a little while, this too will be buried.

[Uncle Mito]-And we must warn the valley of what has befallen Pejitei.

[Nausicaä]-.... -....

[Uncle Mito]-AAA! What th... !?!

[Page 41]
[Nausicaä]-Ohmu! It's the Ohmu I saw yesterday!

[Uncle Mito]-Here so swiftly... how... !?
-Princess... to the gunship... quickly...

[Nausicaä]-Wait... his eyes are glowing blue... he doesn't mean to attack.
-Ohmu... you're...
-[Nausicaä thinking]-You're crying...

-All dead...
-They all died...

[Page 42]
-VRNNNN -GRN -GRN -GRN -VRNNNN

[strange soldier in a strange plane]-To star-board! 
-The wreck of a ship!
-It's that Pejitei brig that got away... no mistaking it.

[strange captain in a armor]-Land the worm-handlers.

-SKSSSHH

[Page 43]
[Strange soldiers]-Chee Chee Chee
-Chee Chee Chee Chee
-Chee Chee

-Skff -Skff -Skff

[strange captain in a armor]-Disgusting savages. They enjoy searching corpses.

[strange assistant in a armor]-The crew has been complaining that having those scum aboard defiles a proud ship of the imperial guard.

[strange captain in a armor]-Perhaps. But they're usefull to have on a search.
-We HAVE to find it--at all costs.

-snff snff -KWEE KWEE

[strange captain in a armor]-It's been taken by someone? Are you sure?

[strange soldier]-From the way the fungi are sprouting, the brig probably crashed this morning. 
-The smell is here, but that which you are seeking is gone.

[Page 44]
[strange soldier]-My slug - Worms felt the scent strongly on the body that wore this crown...
-... and that body had been carefully buried.

[strange captain in a armor is thinking]-The princess of Pejitei wore such crowns...

[strange soldier]-There are signs of a small ship putting down, over there.

[strange assistant in a armor]-Commander, do you thing that ship took it?

[strange captain in a armor]-If it's a ship from these parts, then...

[strange assistant in a armor is screaming]-All prepare for immediate takeoff!

-KSHOOM KSHOOOM KSHOOM KSHOOM

[strange assistant in a armor is screaming]-To the valley of wind!

-VRNNNNN

-OOOOOooo

[Page 45]
[Man of the valley of the wind]-Princess... you were so late... we were worried!
[Other man of the valley of the wind]-What happened? The fuselage looks like you've been in combat!

[Nausicaä]-There's been an incident. Bring the fire-wands, quickly!
-There are still spores in the cockpit.

[Man of the valley]-Y-yes, my lady. You've been to the sea of corruption again...?

[Nausicaä]-Teto, be still! It'll only take a minute.

-THMP THMP POK PDK

[Teto]-Yeeow! Don't get it so close!
-That's what you get for going to the rotwood! 
-If even one of those gets into the fields, there'll be an uproar, let me tell you!

-FSHH

[Nausicaä]-Tell no one until make an announcement.
-And reload the main guns. Have her ready to fly at a moment's notice.

[Teto]-Yes, my lady.

[Page 46]
[Teto]-Princess! What's all the excitement?
-Al, wind-watcher! Tighten the guard!

[Nausicaä]-OH! Sorry!
-FATHER!
-It's terrible! The city of Pejitei...

[Nausicaä's father]-STOP! What is the meaning of this Nausicaä!?
-No matter what happens, there is no excuse for a chieftain to lose control.
-If their leader is in a panic, the people will be allarmed and shaken.
-My body has all but turned to stone. The destiny of this valley is on your shoulders.

[Lord Yupa thinking]-Jhil... must you lay such a burden on this child... ?

[Lord Yupa talks]-The graver the crisis, the calmer you must be, like a pinnacle of rock in the whirl-wind.

[Nausicaä's father]-If you understand, then speak.

[Nausicaä]-Yes, father.

[Page 47]
[Nausicaä]-The city of Pejitei has been destroyed?!
-There was only one refugee ship. It was attacked by forest insects and crashed. 
-It was horrible, father...

[Nausicaä's father]-Pejitei was a peaceful industrial city... and our friends! Why would the emperor...

[Lord Yupa]-I've never seen such a thing before.

[Nausicaä's father]-It seems to be part of some machine, but it's terrible old.
-Pejitei has a mineshaft, they've dug to excavate engines from one of the ancient cities buried deep beneath the earth. No doubt this came from there...

[Lord Yupa]-If this stone is the cause of all this, it must conceal a mighty power.

[Nausicaä]-If at all possible, I want to carry out the last wish of that girl, rastel.
-I want to give this stone to her brother.

-GRN GRN

[Man of the valley]-What's that ship?!

[Page 48]

-VRNNRNN
[Nausicaä viewing on the window]-A torumekian armored corvette!

[man of the valley]-That ship... it's one of the imperial guard! This must be serious!
-Call everyone to the castle!

[Other man]-They've going to land...!

[Other man]-Quick! Send messengers out to the men in the fields!

-SHOOM

[Nausicaä]-They may be searching for that pejiteian brig. 
-I'll go myself.

[Nausicaä's father]-Hmm... Nausicaä, someday, you will lead our people. 
-Whatever this is all about, it is your first trial.
-Until you have found the truth of the matter, act with caution!

[Nausicaä]-Yes, father!

[Page 49]
[Man of the valley]-Princess! They're landing on the east edge of the valley, without passing our inspection!
-Damn them... they know they should land outside the valley, to keep out the spores...
-They think we're too small to fight back!

-VRNNN SKSSH

[Nausicaä]-Intolerable... that's a newly seeded field.
-Now we'll have to burn off that entire area.
-Wormhandlers! Why would the imperial guard hire wormhandlers?!
-If we're not careful, this valley could become a second Pejitei...

[Man of the valley]-Wormhandlers! Those filthy maggot - men will foul the entire valley!

[Nausicaä]-Quiet, everyone! I'll deal with this!
-Get my Mehve! Roll out the gunship!

[Page 50]
[Nausicaä]-Uncle Mito! Fly cover for me!

[Uncle Mito]-Leave it to me! I'll blow their ship to funders, if need be!

[Nausicaä]-Hold on, Teto!

-VOM -FFT -SHEEOOM

[Uncle Mito]-Co-pilot! Throttle back!

[Co-pilot]-Whahaha! That's our princess for you... wings to the ground!

[Nausicaä]-I am Nausicaä, daughter of Jhil of the valley of the wind!
-Who are you to defile our country in the company of wormhandlers?!
-I forbid you to advance one step beyond this sword.
-Withdraw immediately!

[Page 54]
[Strange captain in a armor]-We have come in pursuit of the traitors of Pejitei, on the orders of his eminence, the Vai emperor.
-The wormhandlers have been attacked to our unit as special commandos.
-You will allow us to search this valley!

[Nausicaä]-I will not! You will find no traitors in the valley of wind! We are an autonomous nation of the periphery, and we have never once violated our treaties with the emperor!
-Even the imperial bodyguards of the emperor himself must abide by the rules of conduct!

[Nausicaä is thinking]-What is that crown the wormhandler has?!

-PSST -PSST

[Nausicaä is thinking]-Those monsters! They've desecrated that child's grave!
-They have no respect for the dead! It's intorelable! They will never get this stone from me!

[Creatures]-CHEE CHEE  -CHEE CHEE  -snff -snff  -Wrm -Wrm

[Page 55]
[Strange captain in a armor]-Don't me Nausicaä, or whatever you call yourself!

[Creatures]-snff -snff  -Wrm -Wrm

[Strange captain in a armor]-Heh Heh... it seems the worms have smelled out the thing we're looking for...

[Creatures]-snff -Wrm -Wrm -Kwee -Kwee

-KZZT

-!

-ZZAT
-KEEE

[creatures]-Wrm -Wrm -Wrm

[Strange soldier]-What happened?!
-Our lovely slug-worms!

[Strange captain in a armor]-That girl... some kind of magic...

[Nausicaä]-Dogs of Torumekia! You've fouled my body with your despicable maggots!
-I shall not forgive!

[Strange captain in a armor]-Is that so? Then I will take you on little girl!

-WSST

[Page 57]
[Uncle Mito in a plane]-It's a duel! She fell for their challenge!

[strange soldiers in a other plane]-Target the gunship!
-Over there! Wha...?

-RWD -RWD

-RWD -RWD -RWD

[Lord Yupa]-Wait! Duellists, hold your swords!

[Strange captain in a armor]-Yupa! So that's the man they call the finest swordsman in the periphery...

[strange soldiers]-That man... it's Master Yupa!

[Page 58]
[Lord Yupa]-Prudence, Nausicaä!
-You mustn't turn this valley into a battlefield!
-Can this really be my Nausicaä?
-She has forgotten herself in her anger, like an Ohmu consumed with rage...

[Page 59]
-CHNK -KANG -WSSH

[Page 60]
-KNCH

[Soldiers]-YAA!

[Soldier]-NGRAA!

[Nausicaä]-heh
-Now!

-WHUNGG

[Page 61]
[Lord Yupa]-Don't move either of you!
-This knife is carved from Ohmu shell--Move, and it will slice through your ceramic armor like paper.
-Listen well! This is a duel that must have no victor!
-Whoever falls, hatred. Two nations, bound by ancient treaties, comrades in battle, will plunge into meaningless, bloody war!
-To the imperial guards, a question! Has the emperor commanded you to trample the code of conduct of the periphery, and bring civil war upon the alliance?!
-Or would you in your error risk honorless death in a distant land?!
-If so, know you that the people of the periphery will fight to the death to defend their pride and the right to self-rule!
-And you listen, too, people of the valley of wind! 
-If your adversaries trespass in ignorance of the taboos of the forest, then it is madness to risk the future of the valley in rash anger!
[Yupa thinking]-Nausicaä... you've finally returned to yourself...
-BLP -BLP
-But don't loosen your grip, not until I'm done...
[Lord Yupa speak with Nausicaä]-Will you let this duel continue, and walk the path to mutual destruction? Answer me!!

[Page 62]
[Strange captain in a armor]-Ha ha ha.
-A magnificent speech, master Yupa! We'll be first to sheath our swords!
-Carry the wounded aboard. We leave at once.

[Soldier]-Yes, commander!
